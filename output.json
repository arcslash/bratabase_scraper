Any observations or suggestions?\nThe wires at the center dig into my breast tissue. But I don't think this is a sizing issue; my boobs are just very close together.", "images": [{"description": "", "location": "outputs/images/983c2023c2af5d200cb71fbd3489fcb1.jpg"}, {"description": "", "location": "outputs/images/c9ab22777725995779d83639d96cb3d6.jpg"}, {"description": "", "location": "outputs/images/71e3047aeea9a18389dbb68d8c224187.jpg"}], "index_size": "28:8", "size": "28FF"}
